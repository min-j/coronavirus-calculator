## Basic COVID-19 Calculator

This is a basic console COVID-19 Calculator in Python. At the moment, it takes data from the NYC Github repository, found here: https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data, and does the following:
- retrieves requested data
- calculates a percent change between two dates
- calculates the infection rate for a specific day

In the future, I'd like to (in order of ease):
- Streamline the overall process with try/excepts to catch invalid inputs 
- Add a heatmap
- Use mathplotlib to start plotting data points with either the user's inputs or all time
- Retrieve data directly from the Github repository
- Create some sort of GUI
